## 📊 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Project 1: MovieLens Data Analysis
- **Dataset:** [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/)  
- **Objective:** Explore the users, ratings, and movies data to uncover meaningful insights about user behavior and movie preferences.  
- **Key Insights:**
  - 🔹 Ratings are skewed toward higher values (most ratings fall between 3–4 stars).  
  - 🔹 Popularity (most rated movies) and quality (highest average ratings) do not always overlap.  
  - 🔹 User activity follows a long-tail distribution — a small group of users rate movies very frequently.  
- **Files:**
  - [💻 Jupyter Notebook (clean)](movielens_movie_ratings_clean.ipynb)  
  - [🌐 HTML Viewer](movielens_movie_ratings.html)
